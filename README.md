# Masterâ€™s Thesis: Analysis of Privacy Attacks in Federated Learning
Reproduced a privacy attack from academic research on Federated Learning, using PyTorch to demonstrate that averaging gradients across iterations does not protect user privacy. 
Successfully reconstructed high-resolution images from gradient data, exposing critical vulnerabilities in distributed machine learning systems.
